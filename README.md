# MLB-Top-Performer-Analysis

## Background
This is a python program that uses pandas and matplotlib. It shows the top three MLB players in Wins Above Replacement (WAR) and how their WAR accumulated as they aged. A "WAR for Average Hall of Famer" line was also added to the graph to show the approximate amount of WAR necessary to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Hall of Fame voters do not vote exclusively based on WAR, so it is not a perfect threshold. It is meant to provide perspective to the careers of the three players shown. 

## How-to
